# Welcome to the Football Tournament Scheduler Repository
 This repository contains a Thematic Project created by four Manchester Metropolitan University students during their last Semester of their 2nd year of University.
 The project is a full stack project that contains a scheduling tool designed organise football matches, allowing users to add in their teams and put them through a tournament tree until a winning team is decided via inputted scores.
 
 The four university students include: **Salman Talib**, **Asif Mir**, **Muhammad Adnan Shahid**, and **Faraj Rahman**.
The frontend app is mostly created by **Salman Talib** via *Vue.JS*, whilst **Asif Mir** meticulously created the backend server in *Express.JS*, along with **Muhammad Adnan Shahid** Styling the frontend via *Tailwind CSS*.
